# Movies List

A Simple web app uses a _valid_ form to send the details of the movies to the database and another button to receive it and display it on the page. in addition, the app displays the list of movies using `HTTP requests` to **Firebase real-time database** to handle `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` methods, and all _errors_ may occur.
